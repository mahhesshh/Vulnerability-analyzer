Website Vulnerability Analyzer

This is a Python script designed to analyze the security vulnerabilities of websites. It scans a given URL for potential security risks based on specified configurations or defaults.
Features

    Form Analysis: Detects insecure form actions and alerts users if they are not served over HTTPS.
    Comment Analysis: Searches for specific patterns within HTML comments that might indicate security issues.
    Password Detection: Identifies plaintext password inputs and advises users to secure them.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Requests library (pip install requests)
    BeautifulSoup library (pip install beautifulsoup4)
    PyYAML library (pip install pyyaml)

Usage

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/website-vulnerability-analyzer.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd website-vulnerability-analyzer

Run the script with the URL of the website you want to analyze:

less

    python main.py "https://example.com"

    Replace "https://example.com" with the URL you want to analyze.

    Optionally, you can provide a configuration file and specify an output file for the vulnerability report using --config and --output arguments respectively.

Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the analyzer by providing a configuration file in YAML format. The following options are available:

    forms: Analyze insecure form actions (default: True).
    comments: Analyze HTML comments (default: True).
    passwords: Detect plaintext password inputs (default: True).

Example configuration file (config.yml):

yaml

forms: true
comments: true
passwords: true

To use a configuration file:

arduino

python main.py --url "https://example.com" --config config.yml

Output

The script generates a vulnerability report highlighting any issues found. If no vulnerabilities are detected, it confirms that the website is secure.
